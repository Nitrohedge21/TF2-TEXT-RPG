# TF2 TEXT RPG
 Text based RPG game with tf2 mercenaries.
It's a project that i'm currently working on for my uni assignment.

Regen system
- Counter to count the movement being done which then adds on HP bit by bit.
- Don't forget to make a class diagram and also a rules document.

Stuff
- Gonna work more on overloaded contructors.
- Fixed getters and setters.
- Some minor adjustments in main.

Sleepy Update
- Did some cleaning and moved some to the cut stuff.
- Added switch case for the incoming battlestate stuff.
- Gonna try to figure out how i can use DMG with other stuff like primary and etc.
- Added movement but haven't made an array yet because my eyes won't stay open :/, It has a movement counter which is gonna be a thing later on.
- I honestly don't want to keep updating this since I already have a text file for the updates but I started it so might as well keep on going.
- ~~Totally **not** because it looks cool in the GitHub page!~~

12.04.2022
- Added actual map this time and movement is being displayed.
- Classes are still not working properly, might straight up change to using setters inside switch case cases.
- Might make switch case to use with testing functions(?)
- ClassSelector has an infinite loop bug when an unintended input is being used for the switch case.
