# TF2 TEXT RPG
 Text based RPG game with tf2 mercenaries.
It's a project that i'm currently working on for my uni assignment.

Regen system
- Counter to count the movement being done which then adds on HP bit by bit.
- Don't forget to make a class diagram and also a rules document.


28.03.2022
Stuff
- Gonna work more on overloaded contructors.
- Fixed getters and setters.
- Some minor adjustments in main.

Sleepy Update
- Did some cleaning and moved some to the cut stuff.
- Added switch case for the incoming battlestate stuff.
- Gonna try to figure out how i can use DMG with other stuff like primary and etc.
- Added movement but haven't made an array yet because my eyes won't stay open :/, It has a movement counter which is gonna be a thing later on.
- I honestly don't want to keep updating this since I already have a text file for the updates but I started it so might as well keep on going.
- ~~Totally **not** because it looks cool in the GitHub page!~~

12.04.2022
- Added actual map this time and movement is being displayed.
- Classes are still not working properly, might straight up change to using setters inside switch case cases.
- Might make switch case to use with testing functions(?)
- ClassSelector has an infinite loop bug when an unintended input is being used for the switch case.

23.04.2022
- Finally got rid of that pain in the ass issue.
- Cut the majority of the code because it was just like tf2's spaghetti code.
- Alexander (one of the module mates) literally fixed the biggest issue i was having, not being able to access the game object's variables.
- Now I can edit the values of the classes again, Hooray!!! ðŸ¥³

30.04.2022
- Tried seperating the files but got messed up with a shit ton of errors, gonna get some help in the next workshop.
- Added all the classes' stats.
- Made a progress checker function so that player doesn't go out of bounds, although it's not working as intended.
- Made story and welcoming message functions. Story isn't done yet, just trying to complete the game atm.
- Added secondary and melee attacks.

30.04.2022 v2
- Seperated the files sucessfully, had to remove some of the stuff from the header files.
- Added escaping option to the Battle State.
- Player has one in three chance to escape.
- Switched machines to arrays because that was what I initially had in mind.
- Although, the preset machine types are not getting detected for some reason, it copies the default values from GlobalStats.

07.05.2022 
- Forgot to update this file despite making a lot of commits.
- Anyways, this is most likely the final push for now.
- There is currently no ending or goal in the game but it's in a fully playable state with a few minor bugs.
- Brought back setters and getters for the player.
- Looking to hopefully remake this in a 2D or 3D perspective.
