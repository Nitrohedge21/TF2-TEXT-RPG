- Still have the issue of not being able to access the stats outside of the GlobalStats class :/
- Trying to see if I can get some help and fix it.
- Creating a GlobalStats objects inside the classes do not help at all because they use the default values set inside the globalStats class.
- What I want to do instead is make them use their classess' own default stat values.
- Ok so I got it fixed, I'll put screenshots inside the new folder to make it more clear.
- I knew I felt like something was missing and it turns out that I forgot to make the link public.
- class Machines(the child class) : public GlobalStats(the parent class that I wanted to link).
- Just added public before globalStats and it fixed the issue.
- Which also let me fix the while loop that I was trying to fix :P
