- Still have the issue of not being able to access the stats outside of the GlobalStats class :/
- Trying to see if I can get some help and fix it.
- Creating a GlobalStats objects inside the classes do not help at all because they use the default values set inside the globalStats class.
- What I want to do instead is make them use their classess' own default stat values.
- Ok so I got it fixed, I'll put screenshots inside the new folder to make it more clear.
- I knew I felt like something was missing and it turns out that I forgot to make the link public.
- class Machines(the child class) : public GlobalStats(the parent class that I wanted to link).
- Just added public before globalStats and it fixed the issue.
- Which also let me fix the while loop that I was trying to fix :P

- So that never happened. I was really busy this week with moving in and had like no time at all.
- I've been working on it while being sleepy.
- Did some cleaning and moved some to the cut stuff.
- Added switch case for the incoming battlestate stuff.
- Gonna try to figure out how i can use DMG with other stuff like primary and etc.
- Added movement but haven't made an array yet because my eyes won't stay open :/, It has a movement counter which is gonna be a thing later on.
- Will put that movement in a while loop so that the player doesn't move while in the battle state.
- Commented out the testclass thingy because that is most likely not how it's supposed to be.(Not like it's working or anything :P)
